        inheriting that resistance trait from the parent, and probability
        mutProb of switching that resistance trait in the offspring.       

        For example, if a virus particle is resistant to guttagonol but not
        srinol, and self.mutProb is 0.1, then there is a 10% chance that
        that the offspring will lose resistance to guttagonol and a 90%
