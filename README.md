# MITx-6.00.2x-Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science

Hello there! My name is Gary Lai and I am an aspiring data scientist. I am a beginner although I have an undergraduate degree in Actuarial Science and Finance. My goal from taking this course is to strengthen my Python programming skills and learn more about data science. I was promised that by the end of this class, I would have more experience in Python programming and more exposure in the field of data science. 

This is a good course to start right before taking Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera. I am a little disappointed that his class is taught in MATLAB and OCTAVE instead of Python. But Oh well, it has excellent reviews and it doesn't hurt to learn another skill. 

I will summarize this class, chapter by chapter, and post it here. Moreover, you can find the solutions to the problem sets above. For students currently reading this and expecting to find some answers, I would strongly advise against that and I urge you to try harder and ponder over the questions for a few more days. Sure it sometimes take days, but I promise you it will be fruitful and satisfying.
