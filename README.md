# MITx-6.00.2x-Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science

Hello there! My name is Gary Lai and I am an aspiring data scientist. I am a beginner although I have an undergraduate degree in Actuarial Science and Finance. My goal from taking this course is to strengthen my Python programming skills and learn more about data science. I was promised that by the end of this class, I would have more experience in Python programming and more exposure in the field of data science. 

This is a good course to start right before taking Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera. I am a little disappointed that his class is taught in MATLAB and OCTAVE instead of Python. But Oh well, it has excellent reviews and it doesn't hurt to learn another skill. 

I will summarize this class, chapter by chapter, and post it here. Moreover, you can find the solutions to the problem sets above. For students currently reading this and expecting to find some answers, I would strongly advise against that and I urge you to try harder and ponder over the questions for a few more days. Sure it sometimes take days, but I promise you it will be fruitful and satisfying. 

**Unit 1: Lecture 1 - Optimization and the Knapsack Problem**

The first lecture described computational models as a process to understand the world through computation. The lecture quickly introduced Optimization models as an objective function bounded by a set of constraints. 

A classic optimization problem is the Knapsack problem. What is a Knapsack problem? Now, imagine that you are a thief, and you had broken into someone's house, you have a bag and you would like to steal as much things as you can. Notice that you have only a bag, hence, limited space and of course, you would want to take away as many valuable items as you could. So which items should you take or leave behind? 

Do you see the Knapsack problem now? The objective, highest value; and constraints would be the weight. The lecture also mentioned that there are two different situations here, the discrete version versus the continuous version. The discrete version is more like what we mentioned above, the continuous version however, is more like a diet meal plan. If your daily calories consumption is 1500 calories, how many Big Macs should you eat for lunch so that you won't have to eat only salad for dinner? Professor Guttag said that this is his least favorite knapsack problem and I strongly agree. I used to eat two big fat donuts a day and my blood sugar is through the roof.
